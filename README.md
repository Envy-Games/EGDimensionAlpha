**ENVY GAMES - Dimension Alpha: Resource World**

Dimension Alpha is a standalone super-flat dimension, designed for players who want a clean, resource-packed world. This is our first mod release, developed by Envy Games with art by Noqqerz and teleport pad textures by malcolmriley. 

Dimension Layers
From bottom to top, the playable area is composed of:
- 5 layers of Obsidian  
- 10 layers of Gravel  
- 10 layers of Dirt  
- 10 layers of Sand  
- 10 layers of Red Sand  
- 15 layers of Calcite  
- 15 layers of Tuff  
- 15 layers of Blackstone  
- 10 layers of Terracotta  
- 20 layers of End Stone  
- 71 layers of Netherrack  
- 71 layers of Deepslate  
- 70 layers of Stone  
- 1 layer of Grass Block at the very surface

 

Each of these material layers generates rich veins of ores or resources to streamline your resource gathering. Some examples include colored terracotta in the terracotta layer, and concrete powders in the gravel layer.

 

Added Blocks:
Teleportation Pad: A pair of linked pads that share X and Z coordinates between your overworld and the Dimension Alpha world. Breaking one pad automatically removes its partner so youâ€™re never left with a stranded portal.  


Vanilla Ore Variants:  
In Netherrack: Coal, Copper, Diamond, Emerald, Iron, Lapis, Redstone  
In End Stone: Coal, Diamond, Emerald, Iron  

 

If you would like to see more vanilla variants integrated via this mod let me know. We are currently developing "Ores Expanded" that will add custom resources meant for the modpack we're working to develop.

We are open to compatability patch request on demand. This mod should work with any Neoforge 1.21.1 modpack. (We loaded it with ATM10 V2.44)
